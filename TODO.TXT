TO DO:

--Make multiple balls work in Multiplayer
UPDATE: Got multiple balls working but i think the game crashes when the thread is exepting a ball at the
        same time one is created.
UPDATE: With the addball button, the balls added dissapear overtime and depending on how many are there,
        lag a little.

--Once done with this ^^, make an "Add Ball" button on server
UPDATE: WORKS!, adds balls to first client

--Fix the reconnection problem with the server when playing mode 1,
  threads are not correctly allowing clients to reconnect.
  
--Make current clients connected visable in server window

--Add an options panel where you can set your name

--Allow server to set the window size of everyones game

--Fix the clients so when the server closes, it stops thier game.
